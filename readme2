# Tokenise.Farm – Tokenised Farm Liquidity on Hedera

> **Protecting fields, not chasing yields.**  
> A low-risk, Hedera-powered DeFi protocol that helps farmers unlock liquidity from their land
> while keeping ownership, using ultra-conservative (max 25%) collateralisation and real-world
> tokenisation.

---

## 1. TL;DR

- Farmers are land-rich but cash-poor and often forced to sell or over-leverage their farms.  
- **MyBitcoin.Farm** uses **Hedera** to:
  - Tokenise a portion of farm value as on-chain assets.
  - Enforce a **25% max collateralisation** rule at the protocol level.
  - Give savers/investors access to **real-world, yield-bearing farm exposure**.
- Result: farmers keep their land, get cash flow; depositors get low-risk, transparent yield.

This project is built for the **Hedera Hello Future: Ascension 2025 – DeFi & Tokenization track**.

## 2. Problem

Traditional finance pushes farmers into:

- High-interest loans and complex legal structures.
- Forced sales to pay down debt or inheritance tax.
- Opaque, slow and paperwork-heavy processes.

At the same time:

- Savers are looking for **lower-risk** yield.
- ESG-minded investors want **real-world impact** (food security, soil health, local jobs).
- There is **no simple way** to get verifiable farm exposure with transparent risk limits.

---

## 3. Solution

**MyBitcoin.Farm** is a protocol + reference dApp that:

1. **Tokenises a farm** into two main classes of on-chain assets:
   - `FARM_EQUITY` – non-transferable, held by the farmer (ownership, governance).
   - `FARM_NOTE` – limited-supply debt/claim tokens sold to supporters / investors.

2. **Locks a maximum of 25% of the farm’s appraised value** into the on-chain financing pool.  
   - This cap is enforced by a smart contract + policy rules.
   - Even in extreme drawdowns, farmer ownership is preserved.

3. **Routes capital** to the farmer in a transparent way:
   - Investors deposit stable assets (e.g. HBAR, stablecoins, wBTC or tokenised gold – depending
     on integration) into the protocol.
   - The protocol mints and distributes `FARM_NOTE` to them.
   - Interest / revenue share is streamed back as on-chain payments.

4. **Stores key legal and sustainability data** on Hedera:
   - Land parcel IDs, valuation proofs, legal agreements (hashed).
   - Optional integration with **Hedera Guardian** for soil / carbon / biodiversity data.

## 4. Key Features (Hackathon MVP Scope)

For Ascension we target a focused MVP:

- 🧩 **Farm Token Factory (HTS)**
  - Create and configure `FARM_EQUITY` and `FARM_NOTE` tokens.
  - Parameterised by farm valuation and max 25% collateral limit.

- 🏦 **Farm Vault Smart Contract (EVM)**
  - Holds investor deposits and enforces:
    - 25% max collateralisation.
    - Mint/burn logic for `FARM_NOTE`.
    - Simple interest / revenue-share distribution.

- 📊 **Farmer + Supporter Dashboard (dApp)**
  - Farmer view:
    - See current collateral ratio, outstanding notes, runway.
  - Supporter view:
    - See farm story, metrics, APR range (non-guaranteed), risk flags.

- 🧾 **Verifiable Data Layer (HCS)**
  - Append-only log of:
    - Token operations.
    - Valuation updates.
    - Governance events (e.g. community votes, debt restructuring).

- 🌱 (Optional stretch) **Sustainability Hooks**
  - Basic template to plug in Guardian-style sustainability data at the farm level.

## 5. Why Hedera?

Hedera is a perfect fit for MyBitcoin.Farm because:

- **Low, predictable fees** → micropayments for interest streams, updates and small farms.
- **High throughput** → supports many farms + investors without congestion.
- **Carbon-negative & ESG-friendly** → aligns with sustainable agriculture.
- **HTS + HCS + EVM** → gives us tokenisation, audit trail and programmable logic in one stack.

### 6.3 Core Flows

#### 1) Farm Onboarding

1. Farmer submits data: location, valuation, documents (off-chain, hashed).
2. Backend:

   * Stores hashed docs.
   * Calls HTS to create `FARM_EQUITY` and `FARM_NOTE`.
   * Deploys / configures Farm Vault contract with:

     * Farm valuation.
     * 25% maximum collateral parameter.
3. HCS logs an immutable “FarmOnboarded” event.

#### 2) Investor Deposit & Token Minting

1. Investor selects a farm, approves deposit of HBAR/stable asset.
2. Vault contract:

   * Checks new collateral ratio doesn’t exceed 25%.
   * Mints `FARM_NOTE` tokens to the investor.
   * Emits events (mirrored via HCS).

#### 3) Payouts & Exit

1. Farm generates revenue (off-chain for MVP; simulated in dApp).
2. Farmer or protocol triggers payout:

   * Contract distributes funds pro-rata to `FARM_NOTE` holders.
3. Investors can:

   * Hold the notes.
   * Redeem/burn them for underlying value when farm repays.
