Tokenise.Farm — 30 Second Demo

This video walks through the core MVP flow built during the Hedera Ascension Hackathon:

Farm Onboarding Wizard
A simple multi-step UI where a farmer enters their property details (hectares, location, estimated value).

25% Safe Collateral Model
The system calculates the maximum safe tokenisation limit using a conservative 25% LTV rule developed for farmland safety.

Hedera Token Creation
The backend uses Hedera HTS to mint a new fungible token representing the farm-backed collateral.
(1 token = £1 for the MVP.)

Success Screen + Token ID
The app displays a confirmation showing the newly created token ID and supply allocation.

Dashboard & Summary
The farmer can see their minted supply and metadata in a clean dashboard layout.

This demonstrates the complete tokenisation journey from land input → collateral modelling → HTS mint → confirmation.
